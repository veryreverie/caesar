Inputs
----------------------------------------
Caesar currently only runs interactively.
It requires a castep .cell file in the working directory.
Atom positions and masses, and the lattice parameters, must be supplied.

Caesar requires a run script to run DFT.
This will be called from the working directory, and given a number of command line arguments.
An example run script can be found in CAESAR/doc/input_files.
