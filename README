CAESAR

----------------------------------------
Installation
----------------------------------------
To install Caesar in-directory, run

	./compile.sh

from the CAESAR/ directory.

Out-of-directory installation not currently supported.

To return the CAESAR directory to its original state, run

  ./compile.sh clean

from the CAESAR directory. This will undo all changes made by ./compile.sh.

----------------------------------------
Running
----------------------------------------
For help, run

  caesar -h

All of the programs and scripts used in Caesar will be in CAESAR/bin after installation. CAESAR/bin must be on path for the duration of use, since Caesar calls a number of shell scripts.

Example input files can be found in CAESAR/doc/input_files
